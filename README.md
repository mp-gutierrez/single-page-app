<h2>Title of the project</h2>
    SPA
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
    A single-page app with a navbar that holds links for every section.
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
    In order to run the app, all the files need to be downloaded into the same folder, keeping each file name and its extension intact. After running a local server, you can go to http://localhost:8080/ to load the page.

<h2>Usage</h2>
    The navbar on the right holds links that allow the user to scroll between each section.
